    <h3>Interactive AI Testing</h3>

    <p>This set up could also be used to test various robot AI's, with the robot relaying the information it senses back to the Central Hub, which can display it in an informative way.</p>
    <p>Robotic programs could then be debugged, with users clearly seeing what the robot is thinking as it moves about the environment.</p>
