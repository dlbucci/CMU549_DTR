<p>Current autonomous robot technology typically has trouble with planning, mainly due to its inability to map entire environments and the difficulty associated with a robot accurately determining its position in an environment.</p>

<p>We hope to develop a solution to this problem for small, indoor spaces by using a bird's-eye camera that will track individual robots as they move about the enclosed terrain and will collect data about their surrounding environment.</p>

<p>If we can prove this will work for a small enclosure, the solution could easily be scaled to use multiple cameras in a network to allow robots to autonomously and efficiently move about larger enviroments, such as entire building floors.</p>
