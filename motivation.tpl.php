<p>The Motivation for this project was to improve upon current robot technology that typically has trouble with planning and position. Our vision of accomplishing this is to use a bird's-eye camera that will track the individual robots as they move about an enclosed terrain, collecting data of their surrounding environment. We hope to achieve improved mapping speeds, better scalability, and access to intelligent planning that is centralized and adaptive.</p>
