<p>This project will allow multiple robots to work together to cover terrain as quickly as possible.<br/>Using images from a camera with a bird's-eye view, a central hub will coordinate the movements of multiple networked robots to achieve maximum terrain coverage while minimizing time and distance travelled for each robot.</p>
